s1: this reuns NW to SE across the image, and traces are relatively sub parallel, and easy to distinguish
s2: runs SW to NE, and is much harder to depict

there is a 3rd set, perhaps, that runs parallel with s2, but has an alteration zone 
it appears as though s1 predates s2, not because of offset joints, but because some of the blocks
truncate s2 joints. More to the point, when I zoom in, it's actually pretty hard to tell s2 and s3
apart. s2 is perhaps more linear, whereas s3 has more curvature, but the orientations are 
similar. For this reason, probably just best to look at the total density.
